Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?
ans: I would use a remote repository if I am working 
on a project and that requires sharing or colaborating
with more than one person. Can also be used when you 
want feedback for your work.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

ans: GitHub doesn't have the option of staging area that
is visible to users, this takes away the ability to makes
changes being commiting. Changed made on GitHub automatically 
commits but sometimes, yoiu may not want that on your master
branch. So manual pull allows you to pull things only when you
are certain that you want them pull into the branch that is 
checked out.
