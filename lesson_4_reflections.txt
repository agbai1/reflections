Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository 
    rather than keeping all your work local?
ans: I would use a remote repository if I am working 
     on a project and that requires sharing or colaborating
     with more than one person. Can also be used when you 
     want feedback for your work.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
    rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
    with your remote repository?

ans: GitHub doesn't have the option of staging area that
     is visible to users, this takes away the ability to makes
     changes being commiting. Changed made on GitHub automatically 
     commits but sometimes, yoiu may not want that on your master
     branch. So manual pull allows you to pull things only when you
     are certain that you want them pull into the branch that is 
     checked out.

Q3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
    branches. When would you use one instead of another?

ans: Branches are a part-of a local repository. The are
     used to create a repository that can then be made available
     on gitHub provately or publicly. Cloning a repository is a way
     to transfer contents from a repository on you local machine to
     a location on your local machine or from one fom a GitHub account
     to a location on your local machine. Fork is a type of cloning, 
     however, this happen only on your GitHub accounts. In other words,
     forking has nothing to do with your local directory and data from 
     another GitHub repository is sent to your gitHub repository 

Q4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state
    of the remote stored locally?

ans: it allows you to know changes that was made via GitHub or
     by someone else during a collaboration.

Q5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What 
    would be easier, and what would be harder?

ans: sending code via email or a communication platform. Then 
     checking the content when thry send it back. Meeting up in
     person to collaborate is also anothet option. GitHub will
     be easier becuase it saves time and it also allows you to
     see exactly was changed during the collaboration. Also allows
     you to make comments and read comments that was made to changes
     during collaborations.
